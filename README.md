# DotLink: Lightweight Polkadot IoT SDK

## 🌐 Overview

DotLink is an open-source, lightweight SDK designed to enable seamless blockchain interactions for Internet of Things (IoT) devices using the Polkadot ecosystem. Our mission is to provide a minimal, efficient, and cross-platform solution for connecting resource-constrained devices to decentralized networks.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Minimal Footprint**: Optimized for embedded systems with limited resources
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Compatible with ESP32, Arduino, and other microcontrollers
- **Secure Communication**: Robust cryptographic operations
- **Lightweight Blockchain Interactions**
  - Transaction signing
  - Network communication
  - State queries
  - Event subscriptions

## 🖥️ Supported Platforms

### Languages
- C/C++ (Primary Implementation)
- Embedded Rust (Alternative Implementation)
- MicroPython Bindings

### Device Compatibility
- ESP32
- Arduino Boards
- Raspberry Pi
- Other ARM-based microcontrollers

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

#### Arduino
```cpp
#include <DotLink.h>

DotLinkClient client(NETWORK_CONFIG);
```

#### ESP32 (C++)
```cpp
#include "dotlink.h"

DotLink blockchain(wifi_config, polkadot_config);
blockchain.connect();
```

#### MicroPython
```python
import dotlink

device = dotlink.IoTClient(network_params)
transaction = device.prepare_transaction()
```
